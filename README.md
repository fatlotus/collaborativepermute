# Active Collaborative Permutation Learning

In many machine learning problems, we seek to learn how much various people
prefer a varied set of objects. Using the accelerated Trace norm prediction
algorithm from ([Wang KDD '14][1]), we can both generate directed queries and
form predictions based on those queries. As a result, the number of questions
required is dramatically reduced.
